            "Experimentation: During the development phase, we experimented with multiple available tools to determine the most suitable platform for building the chatbot. These tools included Mizou.com, ChatGPT, and Chatbase.co. Each platform was tested to evaluate its capabilities, ease of use, and effectiveness in handling the project requirements.",

The prompt was updated to make the chatbot respond in a cheerful, playful, and slightly sarcastic tone, making interactions more engaging and preventing the responses from feeling overly robotic.",
            "Design: After the chatbot's functionality and personality were finalized, we focused on the visual design.
